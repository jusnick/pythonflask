# Learning Python Flask and SQL Alchemy ORM - Building your first web application 'Lucky Draw' with Python, Flask & SQLAlchemy

The best way to demonstrate your programming skill is to build a web application. A web application can be run by any computer or mobile device. With nowaday technology, a web application can run as fast as native application. In this course, we will show you how you can kick start your first web application, using Python Flask framework as the frontend and SQL Alchemy ORM to interactive with the backend database. 

Programming is one of the very important skills that people value a lot in this era. Not only it can help you get a well-paid software engineer job, but it can also train your brain to think in a logically manner. We are sure you agree with that but you are not sure where and how to start. You may already know some basics about programming, which is good, but you may think that is another level to build a useful application by yourself. Don't worry, in this course, we will guide you how to create your first python web application step by step. You may become the next Jeff Bazos or Mark Zuckerburg!

# Why is this course for me?

If you want to learn about Python, this course is for you! Python is simple yet powerful. It is widely used by tech giants like Google, Youtube, Dropbox etc.

If you want to build a web application from Scratch, this course is for you! This course guild you how to build a workable web application from scratch. Unlike other learning materials that you can find in the internet, this course is complete and well organized. 

If you want to learn it in an effective and fun way, this course is for you. This course is full of practical material, you will go back with a workable web application. This give you all the techniques and confidence to create your own web application in the future. 

# What exactly will you learn?

This course has a goal, which is to show you how you can build real life full stack web application using python. 

Unlike other programming courses which spent a lot of time on covering the syntax and logic, this course focus on the practical usage of the language. We assume you have basic understanding about the programming language (Python), we then teach you how you can build this simple lucky draw web application from scratch. 

This course will show you how to use SQLAlchemy to interact with the backend database (SQLLite). We will cover a series of database operations include creat, read, update, delete records. You will be able to combine the frontend UI design with the backend data handling logic. Since we are showing you how to build the online web application step by step, you will see us using the free professional Python IDE PyCharm. Your takeaway after this course is a workable web application with a beautiful UI. 

We are trying to keep the course short and straight forward, so you can pick up the necessary skill to kick start your first web application in a few hours. 

You can also take this chance to revise important programming concept in Python. 

# What is Python?

Python is a simple, intuitive, yet powerful programming language. It is an high-level programming language invented back in 1991. It is a go-to language for beginners because it is so easy and expressive. You can often express concepts with very few lines of code. That's why we choose Python as the programming language for this course!

However, don't have a misunderstanding that Python is only for beginner. It is used in many areas including data analysis, finance, scientific research, artificial intelligence etc. Python is a very powerful programming language and is well supported the community. There are lots of useful packages like Numpy, Scipy etc. It is a programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms like procedural, functional, object-oriented etc. 

In a nutshell, if you can only learn one programming language, Python is your choice! And if you are a beginner and you want to grab the basics before taking this course, we recommend you to enroll our python beginner course - [Learn Python in a Day](http://bit.ly/pythonDay).

# What is Flask?

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It supports extensions that can add application features and making the web applications built on Flask more powerful. Extensions are updated far more regularly than the core Flask program. In this course, we will cover Flask as well as other necessary extensions that are required to build this production grade party web platform. Flask is commonly used with MongoDB (which we will cover in this course as well), allowing it more control over databases and history.

# What is PyCharm?

PyCharm is a professional Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment) developed by Jetbrains. It has a free community edition and which is more than good enough for this course. It is a powerful IDE that can significantly improve the development efficiency by providing project management, syntax highlight, syntax suggestion and version control.
